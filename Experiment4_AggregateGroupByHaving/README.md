# Experiment 4: Aggregate Functions, Group By and Having Clause

## AIM
To study and implement aggregate functions, GROUP BY, and HAVING clause with suitable examples.

## THEORY

### Aggregate Functions
These perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

- **MIN()** – Smallest value  
- **MAX()** – Largest value  
- **COUNT()** – Number of rows  
- **SUM()** – Total of values  
- **AVG()** – Average of values

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### GROUP BY
Groups records with the same values in specified columns.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```
### HAVING
Filters the grouped records based on aggregate conditions.
**Syntax:**
```
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING condition;
```

**Question 1**

```
What is the average duration of insurance coverage for patients covered by each insurance company?

Sample table:Insurance Table

name               type
-----------------  ----------
InsuranceID        INTEGER
PatientID          INTEGER
InsuranceCompany   TEXT
PolicyNumber       TEXT
PolicyHolder       TEXT
StartDate          DATE
EndDate            DATE
For example:

Result
InsuranceCompany  AvgCoverageDurationDays
----------------  -----------------------
ABC Insurance     7.0
DEF Insurance     3.0
JKL Insurance     3.0
STU Insurance     3.0
VWX Insurance     3.0
XYZ Insurance     3.0
YZA Insurance     3.0
```
SQL code 
```
SELECT InsuranceCompany,AVG((EndDate - StartDate)) AS AvgCoverageDurationDays
FROM Insurance
GROUP BY InsuranceCompany;
```
