# Experiment 6: Joins

## AIM
To study and implement different types of joins.

## THEORY

SQL Joins are used to combine records from two or more tables based on a related column.

### 1. INNER JOIN
Returns records with matching values in both tables.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### 2. LEFT JOIN
Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```
### 3. RIGHT JOIN
Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```
### 4. FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

**Question 1**

Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views
AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

THEORY
Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:

WHERE clause
HAVING clause
FROM clause
Types:

Single-row subquery: Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
Multiple-row subquery: Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
Correlated subquery: A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.
Example:

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query. Create View:

CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Drop View:

DROP VIEW view_name;
