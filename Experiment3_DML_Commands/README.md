# Experiment 3: DML Commands

## AIM
To study and implement DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands.

## THEORY

### 1. INSERT INTO
Used to add records into a relation.
These are three type of INSERT INTO queries which are as
A)Inserting a single record
**Syntax (Single Row):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES (value_1, value_2, ...);
```
**Syntax (Multiple Rows):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES
(value_1, value_2, ...),
(value_3, value_4, ...);
```
**Syntax (Insert from another table):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE condition;
```
### 2. UPDATE
Used to modify records in a relation.
Syntax:
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```
### 3. DELETE
Used to delete records from a relation.
**Syntax (All rows):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```
**Syntax (Specific condition):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### 4. SELECT
Used to retrieve records from a table.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Question 1**
```
Write a SQL statement to Increase the selling price per unit by 5% for product ID 15 who's sale is on '2023-01-31'. sales(sale_id,sale_date,product_id,quantity,sell_price,total_sell_price)
```
 SQL code1
```
UPDATE sales 
SET sell_price = sell_price * 1.05
WHERE product_id = 15 
AND sale_date = '2023-01-31';
```
**Output:**

**Question 2**
```
Write a SQL statement to double the availability of the product with product_id 1.
products table

---------------
product_id
product_name
category_id
availability
```
SQL Code:
```
UPDATE products
SET availability = 2 * availability 
WHERE product_id = 1;
```
**Output:**

product_name
category
cost_price
sell_price
reorder_lvl

**Question 5**
```
Write a SQL statement to increase the salary of employees under the department 40, 90 and 110 according to the company rules. Salary will be increased by 25% for the department 40, 15% for department 90 and 10% for the department 110 and the rest of the departments will remain same.

Employees table

---------------
employee_id
first_name
last_name
email
phone_number
hire_date
job_id
salary
commission_pct
manager_id
department_id

```

```
UPDATE Employees
SET salary =
CASE 
WHEN department_id = 40 THEN ROUND(salary * 1.25 ,2)
WHEN department_id = 90 THEN ROUND(salary * 1.15 ,2)
WHEN department_id = 110 THEN ROUND(salary * 1.10 ,2)
ELSE salary
END;
